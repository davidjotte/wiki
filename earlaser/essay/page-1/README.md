Advanced congenital cholesteatoma (ACC) is a different entity from early congenital cholesteatoma (CC) regarding surgical outcomes with either recidivism or audiological data. Nelson defined early CC as that treated using the transcanal approach, but recommended canal wall up (CWU) with second look for stage III (Nelson II) and canal wall down (CWD) for stage IV (Nelson III). It was intended to treat ossicle invasion adequately, but ACC is still inconstantly controlled via CWU, exhibit higher rates of recidivism (43–67%), and have poor prognosis in terms of restoration of conductive hearing loss (1). Moreover, it is more challenging if the surgeon is to avoid CWD tympanomastoidectomy, as recommended if possible in pediatric CC patients (1,2).

The transcanal inside-out approach (IOA) has emerged as a third option for pediatric CC patients, as the transcanal approach is better for exposure of the ossicle chain, reduces the cavity problem (3,4), and involves a minimal incision. The drawbacks of IOA are related to its long-term retraction pocket for acquired cholesteatoma, but congenital cholesteatoma is known to have good eustachian tube function. The excellently low recidivism of laser cholesteatoma surgery around the ossicle chain is well reported, which is also directly predictive of the surgical outcomes in ACC patients (5). Thus, we hypothesized that use of a transcanal IOA coupled with laser-assisted cholesteatoma removal would facilitate complete removal from the abutting ossicle (6). We also hypothesized that stapes superstructure (SS) destruction (via a medial extension) would be directly associated with recidivism and/or postoperative hearing loss (HL) than regarding mastoid invasion as stage IV. Mastoid invasion itself or anteroposterior extension was not difficult to access, but lateromedial expansion of CC is accompanied by difficult-to-access sites, such as the posterior sinus, pyramidal triangle, or sinus tympani (ST) (7). To prove these hypotheses, we evaluated the safety and outcomes of endaural, laser-assisted, single-stage, inside-out cholesteatoma surgery (LASIC) in terms of recidivism, the feasibility of immediate ossiculoplasty (i.e., without a need for second-look surgery), and hearing improvement.

### PATIENTS AND METHODS

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the CHA Medical Center (approval no. 2016–03–021–001). Of the 1100 case series of congenital cholesteatoma that met Levenson's criteria between 2009 and December 2018, 200 consecutive cases of advanced CC were included. ACC (stages III–IV) was defined as CC with invasion of the incudostapedial joint \*\*(\*\*ISJ). The outcome was compared with the published outcome of stage II early CC as a control group, which resulted in 17.2% recidivism with the same LASIC surgery but without ossicle removal (8).

#### Intraoperative Staging

Below is a summary of staging system for ACC (Fig. 1):

* 1\. Stage III: Invasion of the ISJ but an intact SS
* Anterior-type invasion of both the cochleariform process (CP) and ISJ (Fig. 1A and C),
* Posterior-type ISJ invasion without CP invasion (Fig. 1B).
* 2\. Stage IV: SS absent (Fig. 1D)
* We included the lateromedial extension scheme into the anteroposterior extension scheme of the Potsic 4 stage system; SS destruction was defined as stage IV disease instead of mastoid invasion. Of stage III CC patients with intact SS, disease was divided into an anterior or posterior type by CP invasion status. CP invasion reflects an extension from the anterior quadrant of the CC, even if the CC is not visible in the anterosuperior quadrant (8). Posterior-type ACC was defined as CC confined to the posterior tympanic cavity without CP invasion. The origin of anterior-type CC (adjacent to CP and tensor tympani tendon (8)), was hypothesized to be different from that of posterior-type CC (near ISJ and stapes tendon). Thus, CC in the posterior tympanum but with CP invasion was considered pseudo-posterior-type, which would result in the same ossicle invasion pattern as the anterior type (Fig. 1C). Temporal bone computed tomography (TBCT) revealed that anterior-type CC was located medial to the ossicular chain, and posterior-type CC was lateral to the chain (Fig. 1). It was useful to distinguish the anterior from the posterior type (employing TBCT) by reference to CP abutment status and the lateral/medial location of the CP with respect to the ossicle.

FIG. 1:

_A_, Advanced congenital cholesteatoma (CC), stage III anterior-type. Preoperative status of the right ear of a 40-month-old boy. Otoendosocpically, the CC appears to be early in the anterosuperior quadrant. However, temporal bone CT reveals large CCs that have invaded the incudostapedal joint at the medial side of the ossiular chain, triggering the need for ossicle removal despite the fact that the chain is intact and hearing is normal as assessed by distortion product otoacoustic emission. Anterior type CC originating from the cochleariform process invades the stapes anterior arch before ossicle chain destruction in the region of the incudostapedial joint. Anterior-type disease frequently requires incus removal to allow access to the cochleariform process, aggravating hearing loss, even in children with preoperatively normal hearing and intact incudostapedial chains. _B_, Advanced congenital cholesteatoma (CC), stage III (posterior-type). Preoperative status of the right ear of a 42-month-old boy. CC is evident on the posterior side of the incudostapedial joint (_arrow_), invading the posterior arch of the stapes, characteristic of posterior-type disease. However, the upper section shows that the CC is located lateral to the malleo-incudal joint and cochleariform process, facilitating ossicle-preservation surgery. _C_, Pseudo-posterior-type stage III CC (anterior-type). A 39-month-old boy exhibited normal hearing in distortion product otoacoustic emission evaluations. Otoendoscopically, CC was apparent only in the posterosuperior quadrant. However, TBCT of the lower section suggested that the cochleariform process had been invaded (_arrow_) medial to the ossicular chain, a hallmark of anterior-type CC; this was surgically confirmed. _D_, Advanced congenital cholesteatoma (CC), stage IV anterior-type. Preoperative status; the right ear of a 27-month-old boy. Temporal bone CT revealed anterior–posterior quadrant cholesteatoma medial to the malleo-incudal joint, arising from the cochleariform process, and destruction of the long process of the incus and the stapes superstructure. CT indicates computed tomography; TBCT, temporal bone computed tomography.

#### Operative Techniques

The surgical procedures used to treat each type of disease are summarized in Figure 2. We employed the transcanal approach described by Farrior (9), the predecessor of IOA/endoscopic ear surgery (EES). The transcanal epitympanectomy and atticoantrostomy approaches have been well documented and photographed; reports may be found in published textbooks (8,10). The surgical anatomy of LASIC resembles that of EES (11), but microscopically guided two handed surgery using a conventional drill is performed (a detailed description can be found in Supplemental Digital Content 1, [https://links.lww.com/MAO/A792](https://links.lww.com/MAO/A792)). A Lumenis CO2 laser (Acupulse 30 Surgitouch, San Jose, CA) delivering 1 W of power in the continuous mode was attached to a Zeiss microscope (Vario/S88, LLC, Oberkochen, Germany) together with an Acublade 712 (LUMENIS Inc, CA) micromanipulator. A focused laser was used to dissect the cholesteatoma matrix from the long process of the incus, stapes tendon, and stapes remnant (Fig. 2C and E). A fine matrix on the oval window was coagulated with a defocused laser and removed with a pick (Fig. 2F). The use of a laser decreased surgical time with regard to locating the ISJ without retroauricular posterior tympanotomy and delivered ACC from ISJ or stapes tendon. The most beneficial usefulness of the laser was when the ACC was located between the stapes head and medial side of facial nerve, which is usually treated with second look surgery.

FIG. 2:

Operative procedures of endaural LASIC. _A_, Transcanal meatoplasty. A laterally based skin flap (an extended Koener flap) was elevated and conchal cartilage was harvested for surgical exposure and later attic reconstruction. Meatoplasty facilitate self retractor application, of which surgical view is not limited by soft tissue in the attic or posterior canal wall. Compared with the surgical view before meatoplasty, the posterior canal wall skin does not hinder transcanal drilling. _B_, Canalplasty and wide atticotomy to treat anterior-type congenital cholesteatoma (presented in Fig. 1D). Extended tympanomeatal flap was elevated off from malleus handle and anterior annulus with laser to avoid any vibration trauma, which is crucial for wide atticotomy. Canalplasty of the anterosuperior (or posteroinferior) bony overhanging around the tympanosquamous suture line is performed, which facilitates atticotomy around the chorda tympani (_arrow_). Atticotomy is continued until malleus head (_dotted arrows_), malleoincudal joint, short process of the incus, and long process of incus around incudostapedial joint area are sequentially identified. _C_, Laser exploration of incudostapedial joint area. After atticotomy (left photo), laser is used to excavate the end of long process hidden in the cholesteatoma, and until it is confirmed that incus is disconnected from stapes remnant or underlying cholesteatoma for safe removal of incus from attic or malleoincudal joint. After removal of incus (right photo), remnant stapes structure is also marked with laser, which was displaced from oval window in this case floating on cholesteatoma hanging on stapes tendon. _D_, Tensor tympani tendon and cochleariform process exposure. Anterior quandrant and attic portion of CC is delivered to posteroinferioly, which is attached to tensor tympani and cochleariform process. Laser is also used on tensor tympani tendon (_arrow_) if cold knife dissection is difficult, but cochleariform process is to be dissected with cold knife to avoid laser thermal injury to facial nerve canal (_dotted arrow_). Further exposure of cochleariform process requires the laser identification of remnant anterior arch of stapes. _E_, Three hand laser surgery of cholesteatoma removal between remnant stapes and tympanic segment of facial nerve. Cholesteatoma is meticulously dissected from stapes remnant with laser while suction and curved pick is used to gently lift the matrix from facial nerve side. Endaural laser-assisted single-stage inside-out cholesteatoma surgery bears two hand surgery advantage over endoscopic one hand surgery. _F_, Posterior sinus and oval window cholesteatoma removal. After dissection of stapes remnant, stapedial tendon (_arrow_), and facial nerve (_dotted arrow_) is clearly visualized. Oval window cholesteatoma matrix is clearly exposed with its extension to posterior sinus. Posterior sinus cholesteatoma is removed with cold dissection and two hand surgery is continued to safely and swiftly dissect the matrix from stapes footplate. _G_, Single stage ossiculoplasty. Oval window is clearly exposed without any vibration trauma, ready for single stage ossiculoplasty. _H_, Intraoperative photograph of the final status of endaural laser-assisted single-stage inside-out cholesteatoma surgery exposure, right ear of another A4 CC. Incus removal status. The malleus head was not removed during attic reconstruction. The sinus tympani was accessed by tilting the operation table posteriorly. _I_, Follow-up otoendoscopy revealed cartilage attic reconstruction in the regions of the preserved malleus handle and the long collumella. Follow-up temporal bone CT revealed resolution of the preoperative mastoid effusion evident in Figure 1D after endaural laser-assisted single-stage inside-out cholesteatoma surgery; no “second look” operation was required. ct indicates chorda tympani nerve; fn, facial nerve; mh, malleus head; ow, oval window; rw, round window.

#### Postoperative Follow-up

Otomicroscopy, otoendoscopy, and hearing tests were performed every 4 months. Postoperative TBCT follow-up was performed at 8 months for stage IV CC, and at 12 months for stage III CC. Second-look or revision operations were performed when TBCT pointed to residual CC. Preoperative audiometry data were classified as normal if the distorted product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was normal, but as HL if the DPOAE was decreased despite A type tympanometry, compared with that in the contralateral ear. Postoperative hearing preservation was also examined. If DPOAE was absent postoperatively, HL was determined by comparison to the contralateral speech recognition threshold, pure tone audiometry data, or the auditory brainstem response threshold. A postoperative pure-tone average was obtained for every child when the child was between 3 and 5 years of age.

### STATISTICAL ANALYSES

A χ2 test was used to compare the rate of sex, residual CC, preoperative, and postoperative hearing loss, intact ossicle chain, and types of operation (LASIC or CWD) between stages of CC (early CC versus advanced CC and anterior type versus posterior type in Table 1, type III anterior versus type III posterior and type III versus type IV in Table 2, SS intact versus SS absent and anterior type versus posterior type in Tables 3 and 4, and III-anterior versus III-posterior and III versus IV in Tables 5 and 6). An independent _t_ test was used to compare age of patients between stages of CC. Two-tailed analyses were conducted, and _p_ values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All results were analyzed using SPSS v. 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY).

### RESULTS

#### Demographics of ACC Patients

The mean age was 3.5 (standard deviation \[SD] = 1.4) years, and the mean follow-up period was 5.0 (SD = 1.6) years. The male to female sex ratio was 2.6:1. Of the ACCs, 118 were the anterior type and 82 were the posterior type. Anterior-type ACC may be an extended growth of early CC with patients being on average 1 year older than those with early CC (8). The absence of an age difference between patients with stage III and IV CC suggested innate aggressive medial CC growth of the latter stage, rather than a simple age-related increase in CC size. The demographics and clinical outcomes of those with posterior-type CC were comparable to those with early CC.

#### Surgical Findings and Complications

Overall, 98% (196/200) of ACCs were adequately removed using the endaural LASIC approach, and wide atticoantrostomy IOA could expose the CP, anterior epitympanic recess (AER), pyramidal triangle, and posterior sinus if the incus was removed. The sinus tympani area was partially blinded, but CC was not tightly adherent to surrounding bony structure, unlike acquired cholesteatoma, and was thus delivered with a microdissector or cup-forceps without matrix tear. Among stage III CC patients, only four ears (2%) required the retroauricular CWD approach. Mastoid invasion was suspected by TBCT in 21 cases, surgically beyond the short process in 13 cases, but only 6.1% (4/66) of stage IV required conversion to the retroauricular approach.

The ossicle chain was preserved in 70 cases, and single stage ossiculoplasty was feasible in the other 93.1% (121/130). In stage III posterior-type patients, the ossicular chain was preserved in most cases (93.9%) as the laser completely approached the posterior side of the long process of the incus, ISJ, and stapedius tendon. However, in stage III anterior CC patients, although the ossicular chain was preoperatively intact in 50.0% of cases, the chain was preserved only in 15.4% of patients due to contemporaneous invasion of the CP and the anterior arch of the stapes. In anterior type CC patients, incus removal was required. This was because anterior type ACC lay medial to the ossicular chain, while the posterior type lay lateral to the ossicular chain (Fig. 1). Even when the SS was destroyed, the body and long process of the incus were preserved in almost all patients. Thus, single-stage ossiculoplasty with a remaining incus (malleus-stapes assembly \[MSA] or long columella) was feasible in 88.4% of patients (115/130). Titanium prosthesis was used only in six cases, and only nine patients underwent tympanization (tympanoplasty type 0).

We encountered three cases of tympanic membrane perforations with otorrhea, three cases of dry tympanic membrane perforations, three cases of meatal stenosis, two cases of attic retraction requiring ventilation tube insertion, and three cases of TORP extrusion. These complications usually developed together with postoperative methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) infections. One case of postoperative mild (grade II) facial palsy resolved completely within days.

#### Recidivism by Staging and Location

A second surgery was required in 26 children, 15 of which had residual CCs and 11 children in which the TBCT could not discern residual CC by middle ear effusion, thus requiring ventilation tube insertion or a “second look.” Otomicroscopy detected residual CCs in only three patients; TBCT detected residual CCs in a further 12 patients. Preoperative mastoid haziness usually became confined to the pneumatic mastoid, with the absence of mastoidectomy scars (Fig. 2I), increasing the diagnostic usefulness of TBCT after LASIC. Stage IV CC was associated with significantly higher recidivism (16.7%; 11/66) than CC, characterized by an intact SS (stage III: 3.0%, 4/134) (Table 3). In stage III CC patients, the recidivism rates were similar between anterior- and posterior-type with 3.8 and 2.4%, respectively.

Endaural LASIC was also used in the revision operation, except for one case of residual CC that required the middle fossa approach to treat invasion of the internal auditory canal. Two cases required third-look procedures. A previously interpositioned incus was removed during each revision and a titanium ossicular prosthesis was placed.

#### Audiological Outcomes by Staging

Preoperative hearing loss (>20 dB) was detected in 39.0% of patients and was significantly higher in the anterior group (38.5% versus 4.9%; _p_ > 0.001, χ2 test) (Tables 5 and 6). Postoperative hearing loss (>20 dB HL) was also significantly higher in the anterior group (40.4% versus 6.1%, χ2 test). The 25.0% of stage III anterior-type patients lost some hearing. By contrast, in the posterior-type group, both ossicular preservation and normal hearing preservation were more probable. Hearing was preserved in 96.3% of posterior-type CC patients.

Hearing levels worsened after the operation in 15.5% of patients, but 97% of these children remained within 10 dB of their preoperative levels. MSA generally resulted in a hearing threshold of less than 20 dB but a long collumella resulted in a hearing loss of 30 to 40 dB. Postoperative conductive hearing loss more than 30 dB was evident in 16% of patients, usually due to SS destruction. Stage IV patients exhibited significantly higher rates of hearing loss more than 30 dB both before (54.5%) and after (39.4%) surgery compared with stage III patients (10.4 and 4.5%, respectively, χ2 test). The rate of aggravation of hearing loss after surgery did not differ significantly between stage IV and stage III patients (22.7% versus 11.9%, χ2 test).

### DISCUSSION

In this study, we enrolled the largest number of ACC cases published to date. The recidivism (7.5%) and hearing preservation (84.5%) outcomes of LASIC were excellent compared with the rates afforded by standard transmastoid surgery. In two large case series, the reported recidivism rates of CC patients were very high, at 41.3% (33/80) (1) and (68).1% (47/69) (12).

IOA is a transcanal procedure that results in better exposure of surgically difficult to access sites, AER, and sinus tympani resulting in less residual cholesteatoma enabling single stage surgery. In the standard CWU approach, transmastoid anterior atticotomy is rendered difficult if the middle cranial fossa is inferiorly located, and it is also difficult to visualize the anterior epitympanic recess (which is obscured by the ear canal); therefore, “second look” operations are common. However, IOA cannot cope with recurrent cholesteatoma with long-term retraction pockets, that the recidivism is not so low in acquired cholesteatoma, which is also a problem for EES. Indication for transcanal cholesteatoma surgery was cholesteatoma that did not extended posterior to the anterior limb of the lateral semicircular canal, thus mastoid invasion beyond short process was also treated with IOA. Compared with EES, another transcanal approach, LASIC is a familiar and safe two hand surgery that uses a conventional microscope and a drill.

Ossicular preservation during choleseatoma surgery is dependent on whether the CC is located medial or lateral to the ossicle chain, thus posterior-type CC, which was located lateral to the ossicle chain, can be treated with ossicle preservation, similar to early CC. Surgeons should seek to preserve the ossicles unless the ISJ is broken. However, transcanal exposure of the stapes tendon is often required to deliver posterior CC without ossicle removal, which might be more challenging if the surgeon is not familiar with this technique. Exposure of the stapes tendon is much easier in the transcanal approach such as laser stapes surgery than in retroauricular posterior tympanotomy.

Posterior type CC should be differentiated from pseudo-posterior type CC, which is a variant of anterior CC, but confused in otoendoscopy as more benign posterior type because of its appearance in posterior superior quadrant without visible anterior superior quadrant of tympanic membrane. CP invasion is a hallmark of anterior CC, and CP invasion on TBCT is often the only preoperative clue that ossicle preservation surgery would not be possible. The anterior CC showing CP invasion is located medial to the ossicle chain because oval windows niche is medial to CP. When it reaches the ISJ area, the stapes anterior arch is usually invaded and incus removal is required. Even after incus removal, it still poses difficulty to deliver if it has extended the medial space between the facial nerve and stapes head. If the SS is destroyed, ACC continues its medial expansion to exhibit concomitant invasion of the posterior sinus regions of the sinus tympani and footplate; these are the most frequent locations of residual CC.

Single stage ossicular reconstruction is possible if the surgeon is confirmative of negative residual cholesteatoma matrix. The greatest benefits of using LASIC to treat CC are single-stage ossiculoplasty (Fig. 2G) and immediate restoration of hearing. Unlike acquired cholesteatoma, which usually erodes the short process of the incus, this structure is almost always preserved in ACC or even stage IV CC with destruction of the SS. Immediate single-stage ossicular reconstruction was performed in almost all our patients (97%) in the absence of any increase in recidivism. Among our 62 MSA patients, only one had residual CC, which demonstrates the safety of single-stage ossiculoplasty. Unlike in IOA used to treat acquired cholesteatoma, we could preserve the malleus head (Fig. 2H). This was important because malleus status is a significant predictor of postoperative hearing outcome independent of the stapes condition (13). The malleus head can be rotated posterolaterally to afford access to the CP and the anterior epitympanic recess, also supporting attic reconstruction via the conchal cartilage. As the retraction pocket formation rate is low in CC patients, single-stage ossiculoplasty is recommended. Most surgeons favor ossicular chain reconstruction in pediatric cholesteatoma patients regardless of the extent of disease (14). Postoperative hearing is better after single-stage ossicular reconstruction surgery (15), and the use of autologous bone avoids the possible extrusion of the titanium prosthesis (14). Immediate ossicular reconstruction is sometimes considered aggressive when performed with a cold knife (16), but staged surgery is not mandatory, particularly in CC patients (17).

If early and advanced CC is reported together due to limited case volume, the high recidivism and bad hearing outcome of ACC is underestimated, therefore advanced CC should be separated from early CC in the outcome report. Furthermore, anterior and posterior type ACC should be interpreted separately. Although hearing outcomes are worse for the anterior type in this study, this is a result of us excluding stage II CC (ossicle preservation with LASIC) from this analysis, which was included in the previous report (8). Although less than 20 dB normal range hearing was achieved in 51.8% of patients, it should be noted these good outcomes were available only in children with posterior type. Although this study used a large number of ACC patients, it was limited by the lack a control group consisting of different surgical techniques besides of LASIC.

### CONCLUSIONS

Endaural LASIC enabled single-stage ossicular reconstruction through minimally invasive transcanal surgery in children with ACC, without compromising hearing outcomes. Endaural LASIC has the advantages of less recidivism without any commitment to second-look surgery and mastoid preservation. An ossicle status-based staging system was more efficient in predicting recidivism or audiologic outcome.
